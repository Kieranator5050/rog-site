                "The whole logistics system is new to our unit, so please bear with us as we continue to improve the system while using it in it's early stages.
                With that said, I want to be able to trust each and every player in our unit here at ROG, and I will start with the assumption that I can and will.
                Please, do not ABUSE the trust that I and the Logistics Team are giving to each and every member of our unit. If you are caught cheating, you will
                be fined and punished, with continued violations leading to the violator being dismissed from the unit. Know that I have ways of finding and spotting
                cheaters. Please do not make me go this route!

                Have fun, and keep yours' and everyone else's experience and gameplay fun and clean!"</p>
